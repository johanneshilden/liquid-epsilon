==============

A smorgosbord of modules to assist in building single-page, client-side web and mobile applications, using Haskell and the UHC compiler.

Liquid Epsilon is powered by UHC-JS â€“ a project which enables translation of Haskell programs to JavaScript; making it possible to develop modern, single-page applications that run in all web browsers, using Haskell. This project provides various tools for doing so.
